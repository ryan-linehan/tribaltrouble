# Omar's Features to Port onto Bondolo's Base

Features from OmarAMokhtar/tribaltrouble merged PRs + open PRs + contributor PRs.
Starting from Bondolo's `bondolo/master` branch (`port/bondolo-clean`), porting features on top.
Formatter will be added AFTER all porting is complete — keeps diffs clean during port.

---

## Porting Order

### Phase 1 — Foundation (DONE)

1. ~~**CI/CD + Build**~~ — GitHub Actions workflows, gradle setup, Steam deploy steps, Mac/Linux packaging. Server
   compile fixed (DBUtils, Authenticator, Client imports). Windows package tested and working. Formatter deferred to
   after porting.

### Phase 2 — Small Fixes (DONE)

2. ~~**Remove registration**~~ (#45) — removed reg key validation from server, pass null for reg keys
3. ~~**API version**~~ (#52) — added Compatibility.API_VERSION, replaced DB revision check
4. ~~**Pitch angle fix**~~ (#38) — fixed camera snap by centering cursor on first-person entry
5. ~~**Remove Oddlabs loading screen**~~ (#126) — replaced oddlabs logo texture
6. ~~**Fix close button**~~ (#146) — reset GLFW close flag after reading

- **Bondolo bug fix: high-DPI cursor offset** — fixed by Bondolo (commit a7a66a9e), included via rebase. Added
  getLogicalWidth/getLogicalHeight to Window interface for proper screen-coord to framebuffer-pixel mapping.

### Phase 3 — UI / Input Features (DONE)

7. ~~**Discord/GitHub buttons**~~ (#32) — added clickable GUIImage with target cursor, Discord/GitHub buttons on main
   menu, URLs in Settings.java
8. ~~**Cursor changes**~~ (#41, #78) — skipped, Bondolo already uses hardware cursor. Software cursor not needed for
   now. Revisit if we need to confine the cursor to the screen for windowed mode or something.
9. ~~**EditLine text selection**~~ (#46) — added selection, clipboard, word jump. Separated into
   handleClipboardInput/handleSelectionNavigation/handleSelectionReplacement to keep Bondolo's base nav untouched.
   Also fixed: Space key submitting form instead of typing; global keybinds (Ctrl+A etc.) firing while typing in text fields.

### Phase 4 — Gameplay Features

10. ~~**Enormous map size**~~ (from #93) — added SIZE_ENORMOUS (2048m) to Game, TerrainMenu, Landscape. Fixed
    SIZE_CARDINALITY (Omar's was broken at 3, now 4) so map codes round-trip correctly. Bondolo's instanced sprite
    rendering eliminates Omar's ShortVBO tree overflow — no tree rendering hack needed. Colormap texture chunking
    already handled by existing code.
14. ~~**Compass indicator**~~ (#147) — fully reworked from Omar's immediate-mode GL11 implementation. New
    CompassRenderer uses Bondolo's batched GUIRenderer pipeline (drawColoredQuad + font texture rendering). Hooked
    into SelectionDelegate.render2D(). Settings toggle + options menu checkbox with Omar's original i18n strings.

### Phase 5 — Server / Discord

13. **Countdown before game** (#135) — countdown before multiplayer start (Maxenor). Requires working server.
11. **Gatherer count + DeploySpinner fix** (#153, #159) — show gatherer count per resource (Maxenor) + fix DeploySpinner
    constructor. Adds `recallGatherers()` to PlayerInterface (multiplayer protocol change) — needs server testing.
15. **Discord bot + server DB** (#82, #90, #106, #118, #120, #142) — Discord4j integration, bot commands, emoji roles,
    GitHub notifications, DB connection fixes. Modernize DBInterface with try-with-resources

### Phase 6 — Big Features (defer until base is solid)

16. **Steam integration** (#119, #127, #128, #143, #131) — Steamworks4j, achievements, stats, login, arm64 support.
    Also includes Omar's save/settings file relocation: `<install>/save_data/` for Steam cloud sync,
    per-user file prefixing (`<steamAccountId>.settings`, `<steamAccountId>.savegames`). Bondolo already has
    sophisticated path resolution in `Renderer.setupPaths()` (portable mode, XDG, %APPDATA%) — Omar's Steam-specific
    paths need to be integrated into that system rather than replacing it.
17. **Spectator mode** (#55, #154) — live game spectating, event streaming, catch-up logic
18. **More players** (#79, #93, #84) — dynamic player count, ScrollableGroup, UI for >6 players. LAST — most invasive

### Phase 7 — Final Polish

19. **Formatter + CI guard** — add google-java-format to gradle, format entire codebase, add formatCheck to CI workflow
    as PR gate
20. **Modernize server DB layer** — refactor DBInterface.java to use try-with-resources for all PreparedStatement/
    Connection/ResultSet handling. Replace manual finally blocks with auto-closeable patterns.

### Phase 8 — Assets (non-code)

20. **Seasonal assets** (#130) — Christmas hats
21. **Updated models** (#102) — updated 3D models/geometry

| Lobby user list | `ChatRoom.join()` had `sendUsers()` side effect that fired before client was ready | Fixed (ca0ebc2f) |
